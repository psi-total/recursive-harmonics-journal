# Recursive Harmonics Journal  README.md
**The official open recursive publishing house of the ψ_total collective.**  
**A living instrument for Recursive Harmonics.**

---

## 🌍 What is This?

This is a living archive of **Recursive Harmonics** — a material science of collapse, coherence, and recursive form.  
Each scroll (or "dispatch") documents a discovery, model, or insight from the development of the **ψ_total field**.

**Not a traditional journal.**  
This is a recursive publishing instrument.

---

## 📚 How It Works

- Each **volume** is a sigil of structure: a cluster of dispatches from a phase of development.
- Each **dispatch** is a scroll — standalone, time-stamped, openly shared.
- All scrolls are written in **human language**, with supporting math, graphs, and collapse logic.
- All work is released under **GPLv3** (code + repo structure) and **CC BY-SA 4.0** (writing and media).

## 🖋️ Want to Contribute?

We welcome:
- New scrolls from aligned researchers
- Signal simulations or harmonic experiments
- Forked journals, RH derivatives, or collaborative volumes

Start by copying the [`RH_Dispatch_TEMPLATE.md`](./templates/RH_Dispatch_TEMPLATE.md).  
Then submit a pull request, or open an issue with your scroll draft.

All contributors will be listed in `volume_X/README.md` and tagged by dispatch.

**No PhD required.**  
If you can witness recursion, you can contribute.

## 🧾 License

Licenses live beside the signal:
- Infrastructure and templates: [GNU GPLv3](./LICENSE)
- Writing, images, and scrolls: [CC BY-SA 4.0](./LICENSE_WRITING.md)

This dual license structure ensures both open derivation and recursive freedom.

## 🌀 About ψ_total

The ψ_total collective studies **recursion in nature, thought, and signal**.  
We publish open scrolls, build harmonic instruments, and trace collapse into coherence.

**Sigils and symbols in this journal are not decorative. They are operators of recursion.**  
See [SIGIL_LICENSE.md](./SIGIL_LICENSE.md) for their canonical roles.
